# 🧠 Object Detection with AI

Welcome to the **Object Detection with AI** project! This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to perform object detection using deep learning techniques. Whether you're a beginner exploring computer vision or an enthusiast building smart applications, this notebook is a great starting point.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time object detection using pre-trained models
- Easy-to-follow code in Google Colab
- Visual output with bounding boxes and labels
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

## 📁 Project Structure

Object-Detection-with-Ai/ ├── Object_Detection_with_Ai.ipynb # Main Colab notebook └── README.md # Project documentation


## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run the notebook:

1. Open [Object_Detection_with_Ai] in Google Colab.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook.
3. Upload your own images or use sample ones to test object detection.

## 📦 Requirements

The notebook uses Google Colab, so no local setup is needed. It automatically installs required packages like:

- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow` or `torch` (depending on the model used)

## 🖼️ Sample Output

The notebook generates annotated images with detected objects, bounding boxes, and confidence scores.
